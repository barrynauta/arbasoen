You can also provide a local path to your own gedcom file on your gdrive which will then be downloaded and processed (the current parameters for the local file point to my personal gedcom file and will not work for you, you need to adapt). This does require you to mount your gdrive obviously.\n",

The translation is strongly focussed on West-European languages, and the code will probably need some adaptations for different languages. Probably some adaptations are needed for latin languages that make a clear distinction between masculine and feminine words as well\n"
